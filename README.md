## Matlab Calibtaion
Based on the paper [Aligning the Forcesâ€”Eliminating the Misalignments in IMU Arrays](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6879287) - by John-Olof Nilsson et. al and their [code](https://www.openshoe.org/?m=201408).It will generate a imu_cal.h for the C code for the IMU processing board and theta.mat for other matlab code to do post analyze.
